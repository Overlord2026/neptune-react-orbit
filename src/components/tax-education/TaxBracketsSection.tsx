            The U.S. uses a <strong>progressive tax system</strong> where different portions of your income are taxed at increasing rates. 
            This system is organized into <GlossaryTerm termId="tax_bracket">tax brackets</GlossaryTerm>, which are income ranges that are taxed at specific rates.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For example, in {selectedYear}, a {formatFilingStatus(selectedFilingStatus)} filer might pay 10% on the first portion of income, 12% on the next portion, and so on. 
            This means not all of your income is taxed at your highest bracket rate.
