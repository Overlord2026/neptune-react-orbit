# Project Neptune: Advanced Tax Planning Suite

**CONFIDENTIAL: Internal Development Only**

## Overview

Project Neptune is a confidential tax planning feature suite designed to enhance financial decision-making capabilities. This prototype demonstrates various tax planning tools that will eventually be integrated into the primary application.

## Features

The prototype currently includes the following modules:

### ðŸŸ¢ Available for Testing

- **Tax Return Analyzer**: Analyzes previous tax returns to identify missed deductions and optimization opportunities through OCR technology.
- **Roth Conversion Analyzer**: Interactive calculator to evaluate tax implications of converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs.
- **Dynamic Bracket Manager**: Visual tax bracket analysis tool to help optimize income timing and deductions.
- **Social Security Tax Calculator**: Tool to determine optimal social security withdrawal strategies based on tax implications.
- **Tax Vault**: Secure document storage system for sensitive tax information.

### ðŸŸ¡ Coming Soon

- **Tax Document Aggregator**: Automated collection and organization of tax documents from financial institutions.
- **Advanced Tax Strategies**: Sophisticated tax planning approaches tailored to high-net-worth individuals.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm (v8+)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd project-neptune

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Integration Guidelines

This prototype is designed for eventual integration into the primary platform. When ready for production implementation:

1. **Authentication**: Connect to the main application's authentication system.
2. **Data Persistence**: Integrate with the existing data storage infrastructure.
3. **User Profile Connection**: Link tax planning tools to user financial profiles.
4. **Design System**: Ensure UI components match the parent application's design system.
5. **API Integration**: Connect to the core platform API for real-time data access.

## Development Notes

- The Tax Return Analyzer will require OCR service integration.
- Roth Conversion calculations need to be synced with current tax bracket data.
- Document storage requires secure encryption implementation before production.
- All calculations are currently using placeholder data and should not be used for actual financial decisions.

## Security Considerations

- All tax information must be handled with strict confidentiality.
- Document encryption should use industry-standard protocols.
- User data should never leave the secure environment.
- Integration must maintain compliance with data protection regulations.

## Technical Architecture

- Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Uses shadcn/ui component library
- State management via React Query
- Routing with React Router
